# `lure`

`lure` is an improved fork of [lr](https://codeberg.org/arslee07/lr), a small daemon that sets the currently playing track on Last.fm (and other platforms) to the Revolt user status.

> [!WARNING]
> Lure is currently being re-designed. Some code might be misleading and have wrong namings. Those will be resolved soon.

<!-- ## Installation

Grab a binary from releases or compile it yourself (just `cargo build --release`).
